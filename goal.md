Task Manager:
Built for the @ Petalm groupt ltd with the intent of making work more fluid and easier for employees... As well as tracking projects for the consultation company for easier handling and management of financial goals as well as a more mapped approach to organizing each task for each individual at the institution.


The app:
    -> Includes a read, edit and delete function for each task
    -> Should provide a history page that lists all tasks in the database for the admin to evaluate which tasks where completed and after how long for an overview and better team management. Should also provide managers with enough information on how to better approach strategies related to business growth
    -> Should be scalable and usable outside of Petalm; though it is mainly designed for @PetalmAfrica ltd

The build:
    -> Language: JS
    -> database :
